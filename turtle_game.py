# Variables:- are something which just allows us to store the information somewhere!!!
#Website to be visited---->trinket.io
#Strings: These are exactly whatever you type within the quotes
#print is actually a function.
#function:- Here in above example my_turtle is the variable.

#my_turtle.forward(100)
#Squre
#my_turtle.forward(100)
#my_turtle.right(90)
#my_turtle.forward(100)
#my_turtle.right(90)
#my_turtle.forward(100)
#my_turtle.right(90)
#my_turtle.forward(100)
#The things which you want to make part of the function, you will have to indent it.
#Me defining the function doesn't actually call the function anymore!!! If we want to run the function then we need to call it!!!
#Like if you were born and somebody have given you a name 'rishyjee'that's the name giving, they are not calling you 'rishyjee', they are just attatching that level on you, later when they want to call you then they will say Hey,rishyjee!!! And you would be like what's up body!!!
#Alot of time we don't want to chage the original function!!! It's job is to make the square and that's it!!!
#It's like learning a word in english!!! Now once you learnt then you can use it anywhere depending on the cotext!!!






#List:- List is something that holds multiple things at once!!!
#String slicing:-
#Circle has 360 degree
#360/10----->36




#Dictionaries:-Maps
#The idea behind the dictionaries is to map key to values!!!
#It always maps two things!!!If there is a relationship between two things then it's better to use dictionaries!!!
