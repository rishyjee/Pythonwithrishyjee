#While loops:
#You are going to use while loops when you don't know
#when this loop is going to end or how many times this
#going to end for.For eg. If you wanted to do pushups a
#and you don't know when your pushups are going to end
#or how long will it take to me to be tired then you are
#going to use while loops.

#While (condition)---->True
# then body is going to be executed
# Condition example:5<6--->True
#eg. 6<4---->False
